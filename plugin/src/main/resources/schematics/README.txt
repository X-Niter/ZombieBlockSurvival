===== SEVENTODIE SCHEMATICS FOLDER =====

Place building schematics in this folder. The plugin supports both WorldEdit (.schem) and vanilla Minecraft (.nbt) formats.

Structure folders:
- poi/ - Points of interest (houses, stores, factories, etc.)
- trader/ - Trader outposts
- special/ - Special structures

Expected naming convention:
[category]_[type]_[variant].schem

Examples:
- poi_house_01.schem
- poi_store_02.schem
- trader_outpost_01.schem
- special_bunker_01.schem

The plugin will automatically load all schematics in this folder on startup.
