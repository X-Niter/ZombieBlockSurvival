# AI-Powered Development Guide

This project integrates with GitHub workflows to provide autonomous AI-powered development capabilities. This document explains how this works and how to get the most out of it.

## How It Works

The AI-powered development system works by combining several GitHub workflows and an AI processor script to:

1. **Continuously analyze code** for bugs, improvements, and optimizations
2. **Automatically create issues** for detected problems
3. **Generate fixes and improvements** based on analysis
4. **Create pull requests** with proposed changes
5. **Learn from feedback** to make better suggestions over time

## Key Components

### 1. Code Analysis Workflow

The [`code-analysis.yml`](./workflows/code-analysis.yml) workflow:
- Runs automatically on pull requests, pushes to main branches, and on a daily schedule
- Analyzes code using static code analysis tools like SpotBugs, PMD, and Checkstyle
- Compiles and tests the code
- Creates issues for detected problems

### 2. Auto-Fix Workflow

The [`auto-fix.yml`](./workflows/auto-fix.yml) workflow:
- Triggers when issues are created or labeled
- Analyzes the issue and related code
- Generates fixes for the problem
- Creates a pull request with the proposed changes

### 3. Improvement Suggestions

The [`improvement-suggestions.yml`](./workflows/improvement-suggestions.yml) workflow:
- Runs weekly to analyze the entire codebase
- Suggests improvements based on patterns and best practices
- Creates detailed issues with implementation suggestions

### 4. AI Issue Processor

The [`ai-issue-processor.yml`](./workflows/ai-issue-processor.yml) workflow:
- Processes new issues and comments using AI
- Responds to `/ai` commands in issue comments
- Creates targeted fixes for specific issues

### 5. AI Processor Script

The [`ai_processor.py`](./scripts/ai_processor.py) script:
- Integrates with OpenAI's API to analyze code and generate solutions
- Formats changes into unified diffs and pull requests
- Handles communication between GitHub and the AI service

## Required Secrets

To make this work, you need to add these secrets to your repository:

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions
2. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key for accessing models like GPT-4

## Using the AI System

### Triggering Automatic Analysis

- The code is analyzed automatically on push and daily
- You can manually trigger analysis from the Actions tab in GitHub

### Getting AI Help with Issues

- Create an issue describing the problem
- The AI will automatically analyze and respond
- It may create a pull request with a fix

### Requesting AI Improvements

- Comment on any issue with `/ai analyze` to trigger analysis
- Comment with `/ai fix` to request an automated fix
- Comment with `/ai suggest` to get improvement suggestions

### Reviewing AI Pull Requests

AI-generated pull requests will be labeled with `ai-fix` or `automated`. When reviewing these PRs:

1. Check the proposed changes carefully
2. Accept good changes and provide positive feedback
3. Reject or modify poor suggestions and explain why
4. The AI will learn from your feedback over time

## Customizing the AI System

You can customize the AI behavior by modifying:

1. The workflow files in `.github/workflows/`
2. The AI processor script at `.github/scripts/ai_processor.py`
3. The prompts and settings inside the script

## Limitations

- The AI system works best with well-structured code
- It may struggle with complex architectural issues
- Security-critical changes should always be manually reviewed
- The AI may occasionally suggest incorrect solutions
- Costs for API usage may apply depending on your OpenAI plan

## Monitoring AI Activity

You can track AI activity through:

1. GitHub Actions logs in the Actions tab
2. Issues labeled with `automated` or `ai-fix`
3. Pull requests from branches starting with `ai-fix-` or `auto-fix-`

## Troubleshooting

If the AI system isn't working as expected:

1. Check that your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
2. Verify the GitHub token has necessary permissions
3. Look for errors in the GitHub Actions logs
4. Consider updating the OpenAI model or prompts in the processor script
