# GitHub Workflow Fixes

This document contains all the necessary fixes for GitHub workflow YAML files to address syntax errors and update deprecated actions.

## Common Issues Found

1. Multiline string syntax errors (incorrect use of backticks without proper line handling)
2. Outdated GitHub Actions (v3 instead of v4)
3. Deprecated `::set-output` commands (should use `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`)
4. Unescaped special characters in strings

## Required Updates Per File

### 1. ai-orchestrator.yml
```yaml
# Replace all instances of:
uses: actions/checkout@v3
# With:
uses: actions/checkout@v4

# Replace all instances of:
uses: actions/setup-java@v3
# With:
uses: actions/setup-java@v4

# Replace all multiline strings with array.join('\n') format, for example:
const aiResponse = `Hello @${issue.data.user.login},

Thank you for your issue...`
# Should become:
const aiResponse = [
  `Hello @${issue.data.user.login},`,
  '',
  'Thank you for your issue...',
  ''
].join('\n');

# Replace all deprecated set-output commands:
echo "::set-output name=build_failed::true"
# With:
echo "build_failed=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

### 2. issue-triage.yml
```yaml
# Replace:

  `Hello @${issue.data.user.login}! üëã`,
  '',
  `Thank you for your ${type}. I'm the AI assistant for this project, and I've automatically triaged this issue.`,
  '',
  `**Type:** ${type}`,
  `**Priority:** ${priority}`,

## Implementation Instructions

1. For each file mentioned above, create an updated version with "-updated.yml" suffix
2. Use the `str_replace_editor` tool to implement the changes
3. After thorough verification, you can replace the original files with the updated versions

## Notes on YAML Syntax

- Use single quotes ('') for strings containing special characters but no variables
- Use double quotes ("") for strings containing variables but need escaping
- Use array-join pattern for multiline strings in JavaScript code blocks
- Follow GitHub's recommended syntax for workflow commands (GITHUB_OUTPUT, etc.)
