# SevenToDie Minecraft Plugin

A comprehensive Minecraft server plugin that recreates 7 Days To Die gameplay mechanics on Paper 1.21.4.

> ðŸ¤– **Fully Autonomous Development**: This project uses an AI-powered autonomous development system that works 24/7 to analyze, fix, and improve code with minimal human intervention. [Learn how it works](.github/AI_DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Features

- **Custom Building System**: Frame-based building system with upgradable blocks
- **Zombie Hordes**: Dynamic zombie spawning with increased difficulty over time
- **Trader NPCs**: Special traders that offer quests and items
- **Quest System**: Complete quests to earn rewards and progress
- **Structure Generation**: Custom structures in the world
- **Specialized Tools**: Tools designed for the building system

## Autonomous Development

This project features a revolutionary development approach where AI actively maintains and enhances the code while you focus on creative decisions.

### How It Works

1. **You Create Issues**: Just describe bugs, features, or improvements as GitHub issues
2. **AI Responds Naturally**: The system processes your issue and responds like a human developer
3. **Autonomous Implementation**: The AI analyzes, codes, tests, and creates pull requests
4. **You Review Changes**: You maintain control by reviewing and approving PRs
5. **Continuous Improvement**: The system proactively improves the codebase even while you sleep

### AI Commands

You can direct the AI using commands in issue comments:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ai fix` | Request a bug fix |
| `/ai implement` | Request a feature implementation |
| `/ai analyze` | Request detailed analysis |
| `/ai status` | Check implementation status |
| `/ai help` | Show all available commands |

### Asynchronous Development

The autonomous system works continuously:
- It can develop while you're away
- It handles routine maintenance and testing
- It proactively suggests improvements
- It responds to community issues and PRs

Learn more about this system in the [AI Development Guide](.github/AI_DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Development Setup

### Setting Up Autonomous Development

1. Clone this repository
2. [Add the OpenAI API key](.github/AI_DEVELOPMENT.md#setup) to your repository secrets
3. Create an issue to begin interacting with the AI

### Building with GitHub Actions

The plugin is automatically built when changes are pushed. You can view build results in the "Actions" tab.

### Local Development Setup

If you prefer local development alongside the AI:

1. Install JDK 21
2. Clone this repository
3. Build with Maven: `mvn package`
4. Copy the resulting JAR from the `target` folder to your Paper server's `plugins` folder
