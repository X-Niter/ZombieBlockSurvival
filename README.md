## Development Setup

This project is configured for easy development using GitHub workflows.

### Building with GitHub Actions

The plugin is automatically built when changes are pushed to the repository. You can view the build status and results in the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository.

### AI-Powered Development Dashboard

This project includes a user-friendly web dashboard for AI-powered development:

1. After setting up your repository, visit the GitHub Pages site: `https://your-username.github.io/SevenToDie/`
2. Authenticate with a GitHub personal access token
3. Use the dashboard to:
   - Trigger AI analysis, bug fixes, and feature implementation
   - Create issues that get automatically analyzed by AI
   - Track the status of AI-driven development tasks
   - Monitor the overall health of your project

For setup instructions, see the [Setup Guide](https://your-username.github.io/SevenToDie/setup) on the dashboard.

### Interactive Development Environment

You can create an on-demand development environment right in GitHub Actions:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Select the "Development Environment" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" 
4. Configure options:
   - Set development session duration (60-240 minutes)
   - Choose whether to automatically start a Paper server
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. When the workflow reaches the Tmate step, follow the SSH connection instructions
7. Once connected, you can:
   - Build the plugin: `./build.sh`
   - Start the server (if not auto-started): `./server.sh`
   - Edit code using terminal-based editors like nano or vim
   - Use screen/tmux for multiple terminal sessions

This gives you a complete development environment without needing to install anything locally.

If you prefer local development:

1. Install JDK 21
2. Clone this repository
3. Build with Maven: `mvn package`
4. Copy the resulting JAR from the `target` folder to your Paper server's `plugins` folder
