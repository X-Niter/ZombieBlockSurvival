🔧 How to Actually Use This UI System:
🪟 1. Treat this like a separate frontend web app
Think of this folder (ZBS_Modern_UI) as your website control panel, not your Minecraft plugin code.

It’s built using Next.js (a React framework).

It's your web dashboard, not part of your plugin code.

You should keep this in a separate repo like:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
GitHub: ZombieBlockSurvival-UI (this frontend)
GitHub: ZombieBlockSurvival (your Minecraft plugin backend)
📦 2. Run it locally or host it on GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify
To run it:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ZBS_Modern_UI
npm install
npm run dev
To deploy:

Use Vercel (built for Next.js) — easiest.

Or push to GitHub and use GitHub Actions + Pages.

Or zip it up with next export and host it statically.

🔗 3. Connect it to your Minecraft plugin repo
Once hosted, you can:

Pull changelogs dynamically from GitHub.

Use OAuth tokens to make requests.

Let AI fix, suggest, and push PRs to your Minecraft repo.

Add in webhook or command sync back to the plugin (optional advanced move).

You want me to:

Help set up GitHub repo separation cleanly?

Deploy this on Vercel or Pages for live dashboard access?

Build an auto-changelog fetcher from your plugin repo?

Let’s make this smooth.

That might be a problem as I thought the most important thing was keeping workflow and pages in the same repo as the minecraft 1.21.4 paper plugin sense the whole goal is autonomous systems that can keep developing the plugin and keep getting better at developing with pages taking advantage as much as it can to be a fully funtioning modern tool to quite litterally manage the whole entire project all within the pages

🔥 Okay, got it now — you're not just making a UI. You're building a full-blown AI DevOps OS inside a single repo, where:

✅ The Paper plugin lives
✅ The GitHub Actions/Workflow lives
✅ The GitHub Pages dashboard becomes the brain + interface
✅ AI agents run dev, fix bugs, make PRs, manage code
✅ And all of it self-evolves from within

💥 You’re trying to build a mono-repo AI fortress.
That means plugin + workflows + web UI all live together, play nice, and evolve together.

Let’s make it possible. Here's the plan:

🧩 THE STRUCTURE YOU NEED
Here’s how to organize your repo:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
ZombieBlockSurvival/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/              <-- AI-powered GitHub Actions here
├── plugin/                     <-- Your actual Minecraft plugin code (src, pom.xml, etc)
├── dashboard/                 <-- The Next.js AI-powered UI (what I made for you)
│   ├── src/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── package.json
├── README.md
🔁 GitHub Pages will serve from /dashboard
🔧 Minecraft plugin will build from /plugin
🤖 Workflows will read from both

⚙️ HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK
1. Move the frontend into /dashboard
Rename ZBS_Modern_UI → dashboard

Place it into your main plugin repo

Keep plugin code in its own plugin/ folder

2. Update package.json in root to include a build script (optional)
json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "build-ui": "cd dashboard && npm install && npm run build"
}
3. Point GitHub Pages to /dashboard/out or deploy it using next export
This turns the dashboard into static files

Can auto-deploy from main or gh-pages branch

🤖 Bonus: AI Agent Lives in .github/workflows/
Once that’s clean, I’ll help you:

Build GitHub Actions that:

Watch the plugin code

Trigger AI analysis

Commit fixes, create PRs, log them in dashboard

Inject .md logs or JSON snapshots into dashboard/src/data/ for viewing

You down to restructure like this? I’ll walk you through the whole thing.

That's fine we can make that happen, I will have replit ai agent to all that first, provide me a .txt file with all this information and be as detailed as possible to make sure the ai agent actually does hard work and makes it happen without failure or confusion

Here you go, commander:

📄 Download: ZBS_Agent_Instructions.txt

This file contains step-by-step ultra-detailed instructions for the AI agent on Replit (or any other automation tool) to restructure, wire up, and deploy the full AI-powered mono-repo system.

This will ensure the AI:

Knows how to separate plugin vs UI

Builds the GitHub Pages correctly

Connects actions to actual code

Pushes changelogs and workflow data into the UI
